This is the home directory when the command was ran. I got this output because we ran it with no input so there was no directory there to change. It is not an error because there was nothing to change in the cd it was just blank. CD directory will not always have no change but since it had no arguments it remained the same.

Not an error. It is printing what I was asking for which was the working directory and there was nothing to show in the cd path.

Not an error there is nothing to be printed out. When you type cat in the command nothing is being submitted back since theres nothing to print. It was stuck at first then I was able to clear it.
