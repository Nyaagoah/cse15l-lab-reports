Methods called in this example List(ArrayList<String>arr), sentenceConverter(String x) and handleRequest(URI url). List takes in an arraylist with all the entries that added to the server. Class has a field named entries that stores all of them that starts off empty then another class field named start which acts as a way to build on the current set strings. SentenceConverter takes a string, from the entries list, and formats the string if it is a sentence. handleRequest examines the url and checks if the user has correct request to update the website. In handleRequest methods List and sentenceConverter are called if the user appended correctly to the url, adds the input and any previous input made by the user to entries by updating the start field with the new string. List is the method that prints out all strings made by the user stored in entries with the index+1 being printed in front of each string to show when the string was added.
